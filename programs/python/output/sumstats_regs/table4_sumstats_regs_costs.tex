\textit{Notes:} Panel (a) shows average values across destinations. Panel (b) shows the coefficients $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ from regression \eqref{eq:reg1} estimated using simulated data from the baseline model.  Variable definitions are as follows. Avg. cost: average market penetration cost across all firms, normalized by the average across all markets. Entrant rel. cost: Average market penetration cost of new entrants divided by average cost of incumbents. Avg. cost/profits: Average ratio of market penetration costs to profits for all firms. Entrant rel. cost/profits: Average ratio of market penetration costs to profits for entrants, divided by same ratio for incumbents.
